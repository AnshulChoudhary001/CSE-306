1.what is hub?

Active Hub (or Hub with Repeater): These hubs regenerate and amplify the incoming electrical signals before broadcasting them to all connected devices. Active hubs can extend the reach of the network by overcoming signal degradation in long cables.

Terminators prevent signal reflections in a Bus Topology, ensuring smooth data transmission.

26.Discuss how collisions are handled in a Bus Topology?

Collisions are common in Bus Topology; they're handled using protocols like CSMA/CD, which detects collisions and initiates retransmission.

27.Define Hybrid Topology?

A Hybrid Topology combines two or more different types of topologies, providing the benefits of each.

28.Explain the management and troubleshooting aspects of a Hybrid Topology?

Managing a Hybrid Topology involves understanding and maintaining the different components of each topology present. Troubleshooting may require specific knowledge of the combined topologies.

29.What is classful routing?

Classful routing uses fixed-length subnet masks and doesn't consider subnetting within a network.

30.What are the default subnet masks for Class A, Class B, and Class C networks?

Class A: 255.0.0.0, Class B: 255.255.0.0, Class C: 255.255.255.0.

30.What is the purpose of the default route in classful routing?

The default route serves as a catch-all for packets with no specific route in the routing table.
