q.1
Open Packet Tracer:
Open Packet Tracer and create a new blank project.

Add Switches:

Drag and drop two switches from the 'Switches' category onto the workspace.
Name them Switch M and Switch N.
Add PCs:

Add 10 PCs to the workspace. You can find PCs in the 'End Devices' category.
Connect each PC to either Switch M or Switch N using Ethernet connections.
Add Hubs:

Add 3 hubs to the workspace. Hubs can be found in the 'Hubs & Switches' category.
Connect Switch M to Hub 1.
Connect Hub 1 to Hub 2.
Connect Hub 2 to Switch N.
Create Mesh Topology:

Connect some PCs directly to each other (creating a mesh topology). For example, connect PC1 to PC2, PC3 to PC4, and so on.
Connect additional PCs to the hubs.
Create Bus Topology:

Connect a few PCs to Hub 3, forming a bus topology. This hub will serve as a central point for some of the PCs.
Create Ring Topology:

Connect two PCs in a ring topology. For example, connect PC5 to PC6, PC6 to PC7, and so on until you complete the ring.
Assign IP Addresses:

Assign IP addresses to each PC in the network. Make sure that PCs in the same IP subnet can communicate with each other.
For simplicity, you can use the following IP scheme:
PC1 to PC5: 192.168.1.x/24
PC6 to PC10: 192.168.2.x/24
Configure Switches:

Access the CLI of each switch and configure basic settings such as switch names, IP addresses, and VLANs if necessary.
Test Connectivity:

Use the 'Desktop' tab of each PC to configure the IP address and subnet mask.
Test connectivity between PCs by sending ping requests.
Ensure that any two PCs can communicate with each other.
Test Email Communication:

Open the email application on any two PCs and configure email accounts.
Send test emails between the two PCs to confirm that email communication is working.

Now, let's configure dynamic routing using a common routing protocol such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). OSPF is a link-state routing protocol that can dynamically adapt to changes in the network. Here's how you might configure OSPF on each router:

Router 1 (R1):
bash
Copy code
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# network 171.12.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
Router 2 (R2):

Router 3 (R3):
bash
Copy code
R3(config)# router ospf 1

R5(config-router)# network Network5_subnet 0.0.0.255 area 0

q.5


Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a simple star topology in Packet Tracer with three routers and at least four PCs. We'll use the network address 83.23.10.0/16 and create the required subnets for each host group.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Create the Network Topology
Open Packet Tracer and create a new project.
Drag and drop three routers (e.g., 1841 routers) and four PCs onto the workspace.
Step 2: Configure Router Interfaces and IP Addresses
Router 1:

Router(config-if)# ip address 83.23.10.1 255.255.255.0

Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.252
Router 2:
bash
Copy code
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 83.23.10.2 255.255.255.0

Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.252

Router(config)# interface Serial0/0/0

Router(config)# interface Serial0/0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.252
Step 5: Test Connectivity
Use the Ping command on each PC to test connectivity to other PCs and routers.
Subnet Calculation:
For the host requirements:

SN1 * 1 = 44, SN1 = 44 / 1 = 44 (e.g., 83.23.10.1 to 83.23.10.44)
SN2 = 313 (e.g., 83.23.10.45 to 83.23.10.357)
SN3 * 3 = 999, SN3 = 999 / 3 = 333 (e.g., 83.23.10.358 to 83.23.10.691)
SN4 = 213 (e.g., 83.23.10.692 to 83.23.10.904)

PC4: 83.23.10.7 /24, Gateway: 83.23.10.3
Step 4: Configure Routing on Routers
Router 1:
bash
Copy code
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 83.23.10.1 255.255.255.0

Q.7
Star Topology:
Routers:

Connect three routers (e.g., 1841 routers) to the workspace.
Connect them in a star topology, where each router is directly connected to a central router.
Subnet Configuration:

For simplicity, let's create three subnets based on the requirements.
SN1: 313 hosts (e.g., 59.62.13.1 to 59.62.13.313)
SN2: 19 hosts (e.g., 59.62.13.314 to 59.62.13.332)

Router1(config)# ip route 59.62.14.0 255.255.255.0 [Next-hop IP address Router3]

Q.8


Certainly! If you want to perform static routing for networks enabled with IPv6 addressing, you'll need to use the appropriate syntax for configuring IPv6 static routes on routers. Here's a basic example using Packet Tracer commands for a simplified scenario with three routers.

Assuming you have three routers (Router1, Router2, and Router3), and you want to enable static routing for IPv6 networks:

Router Configuration:
Router1:
bash
Copy code
Router1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/64
Router1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router1(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:2::1/64

Router1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:3::/64 2001:db8:2::2   ! Route to Router3 network
Router1(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:4::/64 2001:db8:2::2   ! Route to Router2 network
Router2:
bash
Copy code
Router2(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router2(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router2(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:3::2/64
Router2(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
Router2(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:4::1/64
Router2(config)# interface Serial0/0/0
Router2(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:2::2/64

Router2(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::/64 2001:db8:2::1   ! Route to Router1 network
Router3:
bash
Copy code
Router3(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router3(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
Router3(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:4::2/64
Router3(config)# interface Serial0/0/0
Router3(config-if)# ipv6 address 2001:db8:2::1/64

Router3(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::/64 2001:db8:2::2   ! Route to Router1 network
Notes:
Adjust the IPv6 addresses based on your actual network design.
Replace 2001:db8:1::/64, 2001:db8:2::/64, 2001:db8:3::/64, and 2001:db8:4::/64 with the actual IPv6 networks you are using.
Make sure to enable IPv6 routing with the ipv6 unicast-routing command.
Replace the next-hop addresses (2001:db8:2::2 and 2001:db8:2::1) with the actual IPv6 addresses of the next-hop routers.

Q.9
Assuming you have three routers and you want to enable OSPFv3 for IPv6 networks:

Router Configuration:
Router1:
bash
Copy code
Router1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router1(config)# router ospfv3 1
Router1(config-router)# router-id 1.1.1.1   ! Unique ID for OSPFv3
Router1(config-router)# network 2001:db8:1::/64 area 0
Router1(config-router)# network 2001:db8:2::/64 area 0
Router1(config-router)# default-information originate
Router2:
bash
Copy code
Router2(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router2(config)# router ospfv3 1
Router2(config-router)# router-id 2.2.2.2
Router2(config-router)# network 2001:db8:2::/64 area 0
Router2(config-router)# network 2001:db8:3::/64 area 0
Router2(config-router)# default-information originate
Router3:
bash
Copy code
Router3(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
Router3(config)# router ospfv3 1
Router3(config-router)# router-id 3.3.3.3
Router3(config-router)# network 2001:db8:3::/64 area 0
Router3(config-router)# network 2001:db8:4::/64 area 0
Router3(config-router)# default-information originate
Notes:
Adjust the IPv6 network addresses based on your actual network design.
Replace 2001:db8:1::/64, 2001:db8:2::/64, 2001:db8:3::/64, and 2001:db8:4::/64 with the actual IPv6 networks you are using.
The router IDs (1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3) should be unique within the OSPFv3 domain.
The default-information originate command is used to advertise a default route into the OSPFv3 domain. Adjust it based on your needs.
Ensure that the OSPFv3 process ID (in this case, 1) is consistent across all routers within the OSPFv3 domain.

IP Addressing Example:
Router Interface: Internet-facing: DHCP or static IP from the ISP.
Router Interface: Internal: 192.168.1.1/24 (for example)
Sales: 192.168.1.2/24
Marketing: 192.168.1.3/24
Finance: 192.168.1.4/24
IT: 192.168.1.5/24
Additional Considerations:
Configure routing on the router to allow communication between departments.
Configure DHCP on the router for each department or use static IP addresses.
Consider security measures, such as firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) on the router.
For simplicity, you can use basic Layer 2 switches in each department.
This is a basic design, and you may need to adapt it based on specific requirements and considerations for your startup company's needs.
